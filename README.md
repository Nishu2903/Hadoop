# Air Traffic Analysis using Hadoop

Air Traffic Analysis using Hadoop is a project that aims to analyze and process large volumes of air traffic data using Hadoop, MapReduce, Sqoop, SQL, and various other Hadoop features. The project focuses on extracting valuable insights from the data to aid in air traffic management and decision-making.




**Methodology**<br>
***

Here are the main three points of this methodology used in this project:

1.Data Collection and Preparation: Gathering, cleaning, transforming, and preparing the required data for big data analysis[1].

2.Analysis and Processing: Developing and testing MapReduce and Apache Spark jobs to process the data at scale, analyze it, and extract insights.

3.Visualization and Recommendation: Analyzing and visualizing the output data using tools such as Tableau, drawing insights, and making recommendations to address the business problem[7].


**Requirements**<br>
***

To run the Air Traffic Analysis using Hadoop project, you need the following:

1. Hardware Requirements:

- Hadoop Cluster: The cluster should have multiple nodes with adequate storage and processing capabilities.
- Processor: 16 Gb RAM is recommended (8gb is adequate).
- Memory: 512SSD minimum is recommended.

2. Software Requirements

- Hadoop: Install and configure Hadoop on the cluster nodes. Refer to the official Hadoop documentation for installation instructions specific to your environment.
- Sqoop: Install and configure Sqoop to import data from external sources into HDFS. Ensure that Sqoop is compatible with your data sources.
- Hive or Impala: Install and configure Hive or Impala for SQL-based querying and analysis on the processed data.
- Data Visualization Tools: Choose and install a suitable data visualization tool, such as Apache Zeppelin or Tableau, to create interactive visualizations and dashboards.

**Installation**<br>
***

To set up the Air Traffic Analysis using Hadoop project, follow these steps:

1. Install Hadoop: Refer to the official Hadoop documentation for installation instructions specific to your environment.

2. Set up HDFS: Configure and start the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to store and manage your data.

3. Install and Configure Sqoop: Install Sqoop and configure it to connect to your desired data sources.

4. Install Hive or Impala: Install and configure Hive or Impala for SQL-based analysis on the processed data.

5. Install Data Visualization Tools: Install your chosen data visualization tool and configure it to connect to the Hadoop cluster.

6. Import Data: Use Sqoop to import the air traffic data into HDFS for analysis. Adjust the import settings according to your data source and requirements.

7. Implement MapReduce Jobs: Develop MapReduce jobs to process and analyze the air traffic data. Write the necessary mappers, reducers, and driver code to perform the desired computations.

8. Execute Analysis: Execute the MapReduce jobs using Hadoop to perform the data analysis. Monitor the progress and collect the output for further processing.

9. Perform SQL-Based Analysis: Utilize Hive or Impala to perform SQL-based analysis on the processed data. Write SQL queries to extract insights and explore the data in a relational manner.

**Usage**<br>
***

1. Ensure that the Hadoop cluster and its related services are up and running.

2. Import the air traffic data into HDFS using Sqoop.

3. Execute the developed MapReduce jobs to process and analyze the data. Monitor the Hadoop job status and collect the output.

4. Utilize Hive or Impala to perform SQL-based analysis on the processed data. Write SQL queries to extract insights and generate reports.

5. Visualize the analysis results using your chosen data visualization tool. Create interactive dashboards and charts to facilitate data exploration and decision-making.
