# Air Traffic Analysis using Hadoop

Air Traffic Analysis using Hadoop is a project that aims to analyze and process large volumes of air traffic data using Hadoop, MapReduce, Sqoop, SQL, and various other Hadoop features. The project focuses on extracting valuable insights from the data to aid in air traffic management and decision-making.

**Features**<br>
***

- Data Processing: The project leverages Hadoop and MapReduce to efficiently process and analyze large volumes of air traffic data. It includes various data processing techniques such as filtering, aggregation, and transformation to extract meaningful information from the raw data.
- Data Ingestion: Sqoop is utilized to import data from external sources, such as databases or data warehouses, into Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). This allows for seamless integration of different data sources into the analysis pipeline.
- Scalability: Hadoop's distributed computing framework enables the project to handle large-scale data processing tasks in a scalable manner. It utilizes the parallel processing capabilities of MapReduce to perform computations on multiple nodes simultaneously, thereby reducing processing time.
- SQL Integration: The project incorporates SQL-based querying and analysis by leveraging Hadoop's ecosystem tools such as Hive or Impala. This enables users to write SQL queries to interact with the data stored in Hadoop, making data exploration and analysis more convenient.
- Data Visualization: The project includes data visualization techniques to present the analysis results in a visually appealing and understandable manner. Various visualization tools can be used, such as Apache Zeppelin or Tableau, to create interactive dashboards and charts.

**Requirements**<br>
***

To run the Air Traffic Analysis using Hadoop project, you need the following:

1. Hardware Requirements:

- Hadoop Cluster: Set up a Hadoop cluster with sufficient resources to handle the data processing requirements. The cluster should have multiple nodes with adequate storage and processing capabilities.

2. Software Requirements

- Hadoop: Install and configure Hadoop on the cluster nodes. Refer to the official Hadoop documentation for installation instructions specific to your environment.
- Sqoop: Install and configure Sqoop to import data from external sources into HDFS. Ensure that Sqoop is compatible with your data sources.
- Hive or Impala: Install and configure Hive or Impala for SQL-based querying and analysis on the processed data.
- Data Visualization Tools: Choose and install a suitable data visualization tool, such as Apache Zeppelin or Tableau, to create interactive visualizations and dashboards.

**Installation**<br>
***

To set up the Air Traffic Analysis using Hadoop project, follow these steps:

1. Install Hadoop: Refer to the official Hadoop documentation for installation instructions specific to your environment.

2. Set up HDFS: Configure and start the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to store and manage your data.

3. Install and Configure Sqoop: Install Sqoop and configure it to connect to your desired data sources.

4. Install Hive or Impala: Install and configure Hive or Impala for SQL-based analysis on the processed data.

5. Install Data Visualization Tools: Install your chosen data visualization tool and configure it to connect to the Hadoop cluster.

6. Import Data: Use Sqoop to import the air traffic data into HDFS for analysis. Adjust the import settings according to your data source and requirements.

7. Implement MapReduce Jobs: Develop MapReduce jobs to process and analyze the air traffic data. Write the necessary mappers, reducers, and driver code to perform the desired computations.

8. Execute Analysis: Execute the MapReduce jobs using Hadoop to perform the data analysis. Monitor the progress and collect the output for further processing.

9. Perform SQL-Based Analysis: Utilize Hive or Impala to perform SQL-based analysis on the processed data. Write SQL queries to extract insights and explore the data in a relational manner.
